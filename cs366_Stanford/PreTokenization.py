## this function takes a chunk of text, breaks it down into words, and counts how many times each word appears, representing the words as byte sequences.

## this cell reads a large file, splits it into manageable chunks based on a special token, and then counts the occurrences of each word within those chunks, aggregating the counts into a single global_word_freqs counter. This aggregated counter is then used in the next step to train the BPE tokenizer.
